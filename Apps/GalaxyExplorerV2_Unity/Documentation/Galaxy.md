The galaxy rendering process is outlined in [Case Study - Creating a galaxy in mixed reality](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/case-study-creating-a-galaxy-in-mixed-reality) on Microsoft Docs. The article describes the art and design approach as well as the technical implementation.

## How the galaxy is rendered

The code itself lives in `Assets\scripts\DrawStars.cs`. It is based around a `SpiralGalaxy` object which makes up the stars and clouds and is rendered into textures to generate layers with different effects.

The galaxy is the result of 3 layers:
* *Stars* rendered last but first in the hierarchy
* *Cloud shadows* which create the dark spots that can be seen when looking at the Galaxy from the side
* *Clouds* that make up the fluffy blue nebulas that surround the stars

The galaxy itself is rendered through Unity's `DrawProcedural` via the `OnPostRender` method. `OnPostRender` is being called by the scripts attached to the camera and is used via a RenderProxy script to trigger the rendering process.
