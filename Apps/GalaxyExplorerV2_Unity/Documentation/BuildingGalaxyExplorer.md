# Building & running the application

## Running in Unity

Note that by default when you download / clone this repository and open it in Unity, it will open a new scene. Navigate to /Scenes and double-click MainScene to setup the editor properly. After that, hitting Play will start the experience.

## Building Galaxy Explorer

From Unity, choose File -> Build Settings to bring up the Build Settings window. All of the scenes in the scenes to Build section should be checked. Choose Universal Windows Platform as the Platform. On the right side, choose
"any device" as the Target device, XAML as the UWP Build Type, 10.0.16299.0
as the SDK, check "Unity C# Projects" and then click Build. Select the folder
called 'UWP' and choose this folder.

After the build completes successfully, an explorer window will pop up.
Navigate into the UWP folder and double-click `Galaxy Explorer.sln` to launch
Visual Studio. From Visual Studio, set the Configuration to **Release**
for faster builds (doesn't use . NET Native) or **Master** to build the
type of package the Store needs (uses . NET Native).
